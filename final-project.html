                    <h3>User Interviews</h3>
                    <p>One thing was clear between all the interviews of fellow students and friends is that it is important for a portfolio website to display works and experiences that the I the website's owner have done in my time in and out of school. There should be a level of professionalism as well when creating a portfolio website.</p>

                    <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
                    <p>For the competitor analysis I actually looked through my roommate's website and my friend's website because they both do photography with different levels of professionalism. I found that their website fit the needs that a portfolio for a photographer. There wasn't a lot of words, just big pictures organized in a neat way for people to view. There of course was a way to contact them for their services.</p>

                    <h3>Feature Value Matrix</h3>
                    <p>One of the many things lacking from my portfolio website when I submitted it before, was a lack of content. I only had two pictures on there and my past projects page was completely blank because I rushed to submit my portfolio. I had to add more photos and also  complete the past projects page which was still blank.</p>

                    <h3>Feature Prioritization</h3>
                    <p>My priority was to put more content such as photos which I had taken and the complete the yet to be complete past projects page. But another feature which I felt that held great value that also needed completion was my Midnight feature which would only be active each page if the user clicked Midnight. It would be great for employers and potential clients to be able to view my portfolio with more than just two pictures and an under construction text.</p>

                    <h3>User Stories</h3>
                    <p>User Stories were important because I had to think about all the people that would potentially view my website and what they would be looking for. From hiring managers that I may meet during career fairs, potential clients interested in my photos, to friends who I might just want to show my portfolio to, user stories helped me to see what they might be looking for and how they might view the website.</p>

                    <h3>Cognitive Walkthrough</h3>
                    <p>The cognitive walkthrough was important because it helped me to see that some of the choices I made were not the right ones while others were reaffirming. It helped me see that my initial background color choice of green was not pleasing to users. On the other hand it was affirming to see that the photos were received nicely and that contacting me was easy and straight forward.</p>

                    <h3>User Test</h3>
                    <p>I did three test to determine what people thought of the front page and how straight forward navigation was. My question test revealed that my idea of having a picture of Chinatown without any context meant that others thought different things about it, which differed from what I thought it represented. This was also affirmed by the five second test of the front page. The click test proved that navigation was not an issue.</p>

                <h2>Summary of Findings</h2>
                <p>Through user research and user interviews I found that my initial thoughts of trying to create a unique portfolio site by giving it a green background and using an image of Chinatown to represent the area from which I lived caused confusion and misunderstanding. Instead of creating something that looked professional, it looked like it was more novice.</p>
                <p>One thing that people really liked was the Midnight feature because it was less bright for people's eyes. There were two flaws with the feature however. One flaw was that it wasn't apparently clear to the viewer of it's purpose, and the other was that it did not keep the setting when transitioning to different pages.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="sub_section">
                <h2>Incorporation of Findings</h2>
                <p>My first task that I felt help the most potential was to make the midnight feature more apparent to the view. To do this, I made it different from other navigation items. Afterwards I wrote a javascript function that would utilize the local storage on the browser to keep the midnight feature throughout the pages as the viewer changed pages. </p>
                <p>One thing I realized from the midterm submission was the lack of images and when I put in more images, the page began to lag. This made the photography page less viewer friendly. But it was an easy fix, I found an online resize and compression tool and made all the images uniform in width and compressed the images so they were no more than 400 kb each picture.</p>
                <p id="last">I also made time to work on the past projects page so that it would have the "under construction" so that potential hiring managers would be able to view and assess my skills. Even the portfolio would be a part of past/ongoing projects. </p>
